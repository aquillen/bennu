# bennu
Code and display software used for this paper on Bennu  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02058

The mass-spring model code is built upon the N-body code rebound, 
see https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

The Bennu code example is in myexamples/bennu2/
and uses the Bennu shape model.
This directory also contains parameter files used in the paper.

associated jupyter notebooks for looking at outputs is in myexamples/pylab/  
  (though I move outputs into subdirectories)
These also let you look at the spectrum of normal mode excitation.

Slightly edited rebound code is in src/

Spring routines (not part of rebound) are in src_spring/
